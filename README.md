# Block 27A Workshop: The Sales Dashboard

Overview
This project aims to develop a dashboard in a React app using MUI that displays a sidebar, navbar, transaction log, and FAQs for a given dataset in a JSON file. The dashboard should be interactive, enabling users to view the data generated and the additional information and click to expand or collapse sidebars.

Case:
You are working on a project for a restaurant that aims to monitor sales and revenue generated from various food items. The restaurant has gathered data on sales, new clients, revenue generated, and traffic generated for multiple menu items and wishes to present this information in an easy-to-understand dashboard. Your task is to create a dashboard that features sidebars that can be expanded or collapsed by clicking on them. Furthermore, the dashboard should enable users to view the data generated and the additional information.
